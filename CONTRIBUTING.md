# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for showing interest in contributing to this list! Before submitting new links, please review the following in order for your pull request to be approved.

## Pull Requests

- New links **need to be related to level design in some reasonable way.** This includes tools, guides, blogs, videos, etc. Explain what the resource is and why it is useful in building levels.
- Please allow the resource to mature for a bit. I have had instances where someone will contact me directly to add a resource they created only a few days ago with limited documentation or explanation. Please don't do that.
- Make sure it isn't already on the list.
- Provide a succinct description for each linked resource.

1. Fork a new branch of the repo.

2. **Place your link(s) at the bottom of the respective category it belongs to.** (If you are unsure, place it in `Not Categorized`.)

3. Include the following format:
   
   `- [Awesome Example](https://link-goes-here) - A short description.`

4. Submit the pull request to merge back to `main`.

## Creating Issues

Issues can be created for spelling/list errors, pruning dead links, etc. Authors can also ask for the removal of their content, if requested. Suggestions for new categories, links, and better descriptions are also encouraged.

## Additional Feedback

If you have a better way to organize the list information or other ideas, please share them by opening up a new issue.
