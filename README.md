## Tools

- [LDtk](https://ldtk.io/) - A modern 2D level editor.
- [PureRef](https://www.pureref.com/) - PureRef is a wonderful tool to collect your visual ideas for each sequence of the map. Even if you are not a dedicated environment artist, you may find this useful. I usually gather several images to represent some visual ideas/architecture to propose for the block-in.
- [Probuilder](https://unity.com/features/probuilder) - A free Unity extension that is great for rapidly building initial 3D level geo.

## Combat

- [The Door Problem](https://andrewyoderdesign.blog/2019/08/04/the-door-problem-of-combat-design/) - A blog post teaching how to build more engaging combat encounter rooms (specifically in first person shooters).

## Game Examples

- [Ex-BioShock Dev Shares 'Welcome to Rapture' Secrets - IGN First](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6aDrIJJvxg) - Review of the first level of Bioshock with designer Bill Gardner.
- [One Level Design Mistake I Learned to Avoid From Playing "Mirror's Edge"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiKT4V9x5KI) - A discussion of "Runner Vision" and how Mirror's Edge suffers from disruptions of navigational flow in some levels. Avoid placing where the player needs to go "outside" their view. You could argue flow disruption can be deliberate at times, requiring the player to investigate. This doesn't work very well in high-intensity moments where player "runner vision" and panic obfuscate the way forward.
- [6 Instant Level Design Flow Tips as Seen in "Mirror's Edge"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPBQHYquLtA) - More tips on improving level flow with examples in Mirror's Edge.
- [8 More Practical Level Design Ideas from "Mirror's Edge"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hNDo8aLEDY) - Even more level flow tips on Mirror's Edge to use in your own projects.

- [Bubble Maps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-r6RFK8I7k) - Very handy way to get an flow, goals, pacing, scope, and main ideas communicated to your team without worrying about geo architecture. It also can help quickly communicate initial design language, like knowing where certain mechanics will be employed per room.

## Tips

- Find the levels that you are inspired by and do a case study. You can learn a lot just by breaking down someone elses work. Are there any specific parts that stand out? What mechanics are they teaching and where? It's especially helpful if they provided developer commentary.

- Get playtester feedback early and often. What makes sense to the LD will not always make sense to the majority of players. Catching design flow issues early is easier to correct.

- You can't play documentation. Start blocking out your ideas. Through play-testing, you will discover what works and what doesn't.

- Understand the difference between level design and environmental design. It's important to learn both so you can differentiate the two. Level design is worried about context of gameplay, the purpose of each room, designing from a mechanic perspective, and the overall flow between each room. Environment Design is visualization of centerpieces, how the level "looks", theming, and using props/textures/colors to differentiate rooms.

- Level design is deeply coupled with gameplay design. You cannot have one without the other. List your mechanics and be mindful of how they are introduced and reinforced across your level.

- Good level design guides the player naturally through their first playthrough. When we play a level once, we become biased with an existing mental map ([The Curse of Knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge)). This makes it difficult to look at potential level flow problems. Keep this in mind when getting playtester feedback.

- Nothing is set in stone. Stay loose and be willing to change your block mesh if you believe it will improve its readability or flow. Your original plan will often never represent the final product.
