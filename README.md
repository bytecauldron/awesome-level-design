# Awesome Level Design [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> An awesome list of resources and tools for game level design. üòé

Level design is, as described in [The Level Design Book](https://book.leveldesignbook.com/introduction), "the practice of planning and building spaces in video games." Some resources listed are not completely genre/tool agnostic. However, you may find useful information to apply in your own work regardless of the context they are used.

This doesn't work very well in high-intensity moments where player "runner vision" and panic obfuscate the way forward.

## Tips

- Understand the difference between level design and environmental design. **Level Design** is worried about context of gameplay, the purpose of each room, designing from a functional perspective, and the overall flow between each room. **Environment Design** is visualization of centerpieces, how the level "looks", theming, story-telling, and using props/textures/colors to differentiate rooms.

- Find the levels that you are inspired by and do a case study. You can learn a lot just by breaking down someone elses work. Are there any specific parts that stand out? What mechanics are they teaching and where? What parts of the level do not work for you? Did you get stuck or frustrated at a specific point? This way, you can distill level elements that you wish to apply and avoid in your own work.

- When doing case studies, always check for developer commentary. Sometimes, you will get great insight into the decisions made behind the scenes by other level designers.

- You can't play documentation. Start blocking out your ideas early.

- Get playtester feedback early and often. Think of players as another designer for your team. They can help catch design flow issues early in development.

- Shut up and watch. Do not give the player any hints on how to move forward while watching a playtest. There is nothing more humbling/useful than watching 20 minutes of a player stumbling around your level, unable to find the path forward. If they get frustrated and give up, this is your smoking gun when seeking out potential improvements. The confidence of changing a design compounds when additional playtests share the same issues.

- Post-game playtesting feedback is not as useful as direct in-game experiences. Players elaborating on a past experience is *less* useful to you than directly witnessing their reactions/body language to the level. This is why recording their playthough or silently taking notes during the playtest can be **invaluable data**.

- Stick to a clear goal/demographic and do not bend to the whim of *every* piece of feedback you receive. Trying to appeal to everyone can result in a diluted and directionless experience. Too many cooks in the kitchen.

- Be mindful of cognitive bias. The designers perspective of their level will always be skewed from player experience.

- Players don't learn when stressed. Your level "teaching moments" will be easier to get across in safer environments.

- Players don't look up. Keep this in mind if the path forward is on a cliff or a latter. To combat this, for example, you may want to provide a clear vista of the navigational goal beforehand if it's above their head.

- Level design is deeply coupled with gameplay design. You cannot have one without the other. List your mechanics and be mindful of how they are introduced and reinforced across your level. For example, if your game has a jump mechanic but never provides an opportunity to use it (no fall hazards and ramps at every incline), what is the point of having it?

- Nothing is set in stone. Stay loose and be willing to change your block mesh if you believe it will improve readability or flow. Your original plan will never represent the final product.

- Keep your scope in check. Be prepared to trim your ideas down or remove them entirely through additional playtests, technical considerations, and deadlines.
